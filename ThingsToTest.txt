First of all, I should have a single test for any thing.
Any small thing should be one test.
Any combination possible should be another.
Tests should start by the most important thing that they test.
Config_XXX should primarely test configs and stuff like that.
Stuff like M_Stage and the likes could be part of an Example_XXX type of test.
Some organization, please.
